# tiny-project 🐁

This is just a simple [preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) typescript demo project messing with [vite](https://github.com/vuejs/vite#bare-module-resolving) for the dev server, stupid fast, no bundling and hmr.

Also utilizing [parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) as the bundler. [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) for testing.
